## About the Project

<div style="text-align:center;">
<img src='./client/src/assets/Happiest-Hour-pic.png' alt='Happiest Hour landing page' width='400' height='auto' style="text-align:center;" >
</div>

This project was created as a fun and creative way to gather highly rated bar names & links (from one area) in one space. Happiest Hour began as a fully functioning application with a complete backend and basic HTML frontend. Elias and Liza partnered to integrate the backend to a user-friendly UI. They also wanted to continue challenging themselves after gratuating from a fullstack web development bootcamp - the clock posed many UI and functionality challenges in terms of geometry, syncronicity, and UX.

Overall, they learned much about React and how to leverage props, writing clean code, and working with a symmetrical, functional element such as a clock.
